[Inc Magazine](http://www.inc.com) is easily my favorite. I love reading about entrepreneurship and have faithfully read this magazine cover to cover for the last several years.

Well, this month I’m fortunate enough to have a small cameo in “The Goods” section on page 54 ([see the crm review online](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091201/how-one-ceo-uses-open-source-crm.html)). In it, I talk about the merits of [Fat Free CRM](http://www.hostedffcrm.com) over a few other customer relationship managers tools I’ve used in the past.

Thanks to Inc for the interview. Given this exposure, I’ve expedited a plan that was in the works to go live in the 1st quarter of 2010. BME now provides [ hosting services for Fat Free CRM ](http://www.hostedffcrm.com). To learn more, see the hosting fat free crm website or contact me for more information.
