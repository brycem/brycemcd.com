### I care about building business value using technology

As my [linked in](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brycemcd) and [github](http://www.github.com/brycem) will show, I've worked in a variety of areas and know a lot about developing, testing and deploying ruby on rails applications. 

I feel like developers fall into one of at least two camps:

1. Build it because it stretches the bounds of technology (research)
2. Build it because it will increase the revenue of the business (application)

The second camp makes way more sense to me.

It's probably because I got started building online applications at a startup I helped found called Lab Coat Innovations. After that failed (which I'd be happy to talk about), I worked in marketing and advertising agencies building web applications. I've built a lot of them. I've deployed and supported even more.

#### I'm pretty experienced building web apps

It doesn't mean I don't still have a lot more to learn, but I've already made thousands of mistakes. <strong>Engineering technical solutions to solve business problems is what I do best.</strong>

#### I've founded or been the first hire several times

Again, I still have a lot to learn. But, I've experienced a lot of rookie mistakes that I won't make again. I feel like I have a good "gut" for what works, what doesn't and how to lead a technology team to success.
